It’s what economists describe as ‘forgone consumption’. In other words, rather than spending all your money, you tip some into a savings account for another time.\r\n\r\nSavings is a sensible starting point in investing because it provides the funds you need to purchase a range of different assets.

(11, 'Advice From a Software Engineer With 8 Years of Experience', 'Hello, and welcome!\r\n\r\nMy name is John. I have been a software engineer for the past eight and a half years. I stayed at my previous (and first) company for seven and a half years, then I joined a new one in early 2022.\r\n\r\nThis article comes from a recent self-reflection on the things I wish I had started doing earlier in my career and the things I wish I had done differently.\r\n\r\nWhat I am sharing here may be useful to any junior to mid-level developer who wishes to improve and progress toward the title of senior and beyond.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Career Evolution\r\nBefore diving into the main subject, here is my career evolution:\r\n\r\n1. I interned for three months at a startup (which quickly became a scale-up) company.\r\n2. After that, I did a full year of work-study, spending three months at school and nine months at work.\r\n3. Then, I got hired as a full-time software engineer and kept this title for three and a half years.\r\n4. Quickly after the introduction of the tech career ladder, I got promoted to senior software engineer. I kept this title for three years until I left the company, at which point the tech teams accounted for approximately 200 people.\r\n5. I joined as a software engineer 2 at a company with thousands of tech employees. Despite the title downgrade at the second company (see Big Tech Hiring is Conservative — But Why?), I have been trying to keep the same responsibilities (and more) as before.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the beginning, I was part of the frontend team. The tech organisation was split between backend and frontend developers. At that time, we were no more than 30 engineers. When our new CTO arrived a year later, he introduced an organisation based on feature teams: the Spotify Model. Although there was some friction at the start (people don’t like change), this reorganisation definitely turned out to be for the better.\r\n\r\nI stayed for more than five years in the same feature team. I was there at its inception, so throughout the years, I became the tech referent of the project. Eventually, I joined another team, where I worked until I left for a whole new adventure a year later.\r\n\r\nAll right, enough with the context. I hope you’ll enjoy reading the rest, and that the following advice will be actionable for your career progression!\r\n\r\nTHINGS I WISH I HAD STARTED DOING EARLIER\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Write a work log\r\nA work log is a document that contains the list of tasks you accomplished. The granularity and the type of tasks don’t matter, as long as you keep track of what you did.\r\n\r\nYou can fill in this document at the frequency you want. I would advise doing that on a weekly basis. Tasks done during the week are still fresh on Friday, so you won’t struggle writing them down.\r\n\r\nWhy is this work log important? For the following two reasons:\r\n\r\n* To remind yourself of all the things you have done over the past 6 to 12 months. This is very valuable during performance reviews, so you can show your manager what you have accomplished and why you deserve that raise or promotion.\r\n* To keep track of projects, notable responsibilities, and critical numbers (e.g., decreased latency by X% for a critical service) that you had over your career. This is great for completing your resume, whenever you want to venture into the waters of the hiring market.\r\nI started writing a work log roughly two years before leaving my first company. So, over the past eight and a half years, my work log contains only three years of data (with some gaps here and there). When I had to write my resume in late 2021, I had to rely on my memory to remember what I did during the first five years of my career. To say the least, it took me some time to remember everything valuable, and I’m sure I forgot some of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.Leave the comfort zone\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the best way to learn and become a better developer. The comfort zone is the scope, environment in which you feel comfortable doing your job. It is the teammates you already know and work with daily, the projects you have been working on for years, the responsibilities you have been carrying, and so on.\r\n\r\nBut why would someone advise you to leave this wonderful situation? Because this environment is not suitable for evolution.\r\n\r\nSure, if you stay in this bubble, you are an efficient person. You already know who to talk to about a specific subject, and what file in the codebase has to be changed. But what is better than one efficient person? Several efficient people!', '1702902256blog15.jpg', '2023-12-18 12:24:16', 16, 4, 0),
(12, '5 fascinating jaguar facts — learn more about the third biggest cat in the world', 'Big cats are some of the most captivating wild animals. Elusive, powerful, and graceful. Lions and tigers are easily identifiable and greatly loved, but there’s far more to the world of big cats than these icons.\r\n\r\n\r\nJaguars are some of the most beautiful and mysterious big cats in the world, but few people know much about them. World Animal Protection wants to put that right.\r\n\r\nWe’ve produced a short documentary Jaguar Spirit, to highlight these incredible animals and the challenges they face. To get you ready for the documentary, let’s whet your appetite with some amazing jaguar facts.\r\n\r\n1. Jaguars are the third largest cats in the world\r\n\r\nJaguars are “big” cats packed into a smaller form factor. They’re the largest cat in the Americas and are the third largest cat in the world, behind tigers and lions. Males weigh up to 120kg, while the smaller females reach a maximum of 100kg. To put this in context, jaguars are about half the weight of a lion, but more than double that of a cheetah.\r\n\r\nHowever, jaguars are no taller than a meter, making them powerful but relatively compact compared to lions and tigers.\r\n\r\n2. Jaguars were revered by Mesoamerican civilizations\r\n\r\nTemple of the Great Jaguar, located in Guatemala, is located in one of the largest cities and archaeological sites of the pre-Columbian Maya civilization.\r\n\r\nIn Mesoamerican indigenous communities, jaguars were one of the most revered animals. Every major Mesoamerican civilization had a jaguar god, many of which were important parts of their religion. These communities viewed jaguars as symbols of strength and power.\r\n\r\nFor example, the Aztecs named their most elite warriors “cuāuhocēlōtl”, a combination of the Aztec words for eagle and jaguar. They wore costumes that made them resemble these majestic cats and lead their communities both on the battlefield and at home. In Aztec culture, many believed that shamans could transform into jaguars at will and would become jaguars after they died.\r\n\r\n3. Jaguar spots are unique\r\n\r\nLearning to tell jaguars apart from other big cats is easy. They have beautiful tan and orange fur covered with black spots known as rosettes.\r\n\r\nThese rosettes are different from the spots on any other cat. Each rosette is a jagged circle that makes up an outer ring with a single black spot in the middle.\r\n\r\nOther spotted cats have the ring that characterises the rosettes, but none have the central spot of the jaguar.\r\n\r\n4. Jaguars love swimming\r\n\r\nUnlike most domestic cats, jaguars are excellent swimmers and love the water. They can fully submerge and dive in pursuit of prey if needed and won’t hesitate to attack prey animals in the water.\r\n\r\n5. Jaguars look after their cubs\r\n\r\nJaguars don’t have big litters. They typically have two cubs at one time (though they can have up to four). The cubs are born completely helpless and blind. They remain with their mother for two years as they grow and learn to hunt and take care of themselves.\r\n\r\nJaguars are sentient beings, meaning they think and feel and have personalities and needs of their own. The breakthrough research and studies of animals\' feelings and emotions show how the life of a wild animal, like a jaguar, is mentally and physically better in the wild with its cubs.', '1702902850blog103.jpg', '2023-12-18 12:34:10', 9, 4, 1),
(13, 'Trapped in war - captive animals suffer too. They belong in the wild', 'Zoo animals are trapped by design. They are either taken or bred in an environment that’s not their natural habitat, and forced into enclosures so that they can’t escape, for the benefit of paying visitors. This leads to tragedy when their enclosures are no longer in a safe place and the income dries up as we have seen in Ukraine.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe war in Ukraine is heart-breaking - countless innocent lives are being lost every day, and 4.3 million[1] people have fled the country. We are devastated by the humanitarian tragedy unfolding, and are deeply disturbed by the immense suffering this is causing for animals.\r\n\r\nAnimals are often the forgotten victims of conflicts and wars.\r\n\r\nIn particular, zoo animals in Ukraine have found themselves trapped in the middle of a terrifying conflict through no fault of their own. This has led to the prospect of some zoos stating that they will have to euthanise many of their animals[2], which has led to a despairing outcry, and rightly so.\r\n\r\nZoo animals are trapped by design. They are either taken or bred in an environment that’s not their natural habitat, and forced into enclosures so that they can’t escape, for the benefit of paying visitors. This leads to tragedy when their enclosures are no longer in a safe place and the income dries up as we have seen in in Ukraine.\r\n\r\nThe Geneva Conventions highlight humanitarian rights during war – yet animals’ rights aren’t considered, and places such as zoos - set up for entertainment purposes, often become battlegrounds in conflicts. The animals are captive and unable to flee – yet are subject to regular attacks. We strongly believe that both civilians and animals deserve protection.\r\n\r\nAs a result of attacks, many animals have been killed, or the zoo enclosures have been partly destroyed. This presents immense dangers to both animals and people if they escape - especially in urban areas[3]. The loud noises and sights of war also lead animals to become traumatised and stressed[4]. This has been seen at Kyiv Zoo, where animals are being given sedatives, and in some cases, moved underground where their keepers stay with them for comfort[5].\r\n\r\nBut this situation isn’t unique, and it’s not just challenging during wars. We recently saw a similar situation with the covid pandemic. Thailand was hit hard by the crisis, when international tourism dried up, and attractions were left empty. Tourism camps housing captive elephants were shut down, and thousands of staff were laid off. The country’s 2,000-plus captive elephant population was left in a precarious situation where owners were struggling to provide them with the basics such as food and medical care.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fact is, when animals are taken out of their natural environment, it makes them dependent on humans. Placing complex, intelligent and endangered wild animals, in captivity is not only cruel, it also leaves them at the mercy of external crises like economic downturns, pandemics, or war.\r\n\r\nIn Thailand, we were able to step in and help, as we have done in the past. We provided emergency help for numerous elephants in their time of need. But with war, this is sadly a lot more complex.\r\n\r\nFirstly, there are supply issues and shortages of food and medicines in war-struck regions. Carnivores in particular such as big cats, need huge amounts of meat which is not only expensive, but difficult to obtain.\r\n\r\nSecondly, reaching the premises can be logistically challenging. Above all – it’s extremely dangerous, and made worse by the fact that safe corridors have not been made a guarantee. Loading already stressed animals into crates to be transported through chaotic conflict zones can cause severe illness or even death[6], not to mention the threat of being hit by military strikes. There are also specialist transport needs, such as mobile cages to consider. We are currently seeing zoos, directly in the firing lines, being subjected to shelling. Sending people in to provide supplies or even rescue animals, puts their lives at risk too.\r\n\r\nThirdly – finding safe places for so many animals is a challenge when the zoos are responsible for hundreds of animals. Mykolaiv Zoo alone for example, positioned in an area of fighting, has 4,000 wild animals, from 200 different species. Wild animals have complex needs and will need life-long care. This is no small feat – it’s an expensive commitment.\r\n\r\nThese are just a small handful of factors to consider and are by no means an exhaustive list.\r\n\r\nWe recently helped fund the rescue of a former circus bear called Masha from Ukraine, who was taken to our partner sanctuary in Romania, AMP, following a life of cruelty[7]. It was a herculean effort to evacuate her, but she made it to the sanctuary and it was a joyous thing to see enjoying her newly found freedom. Tragically, her well-deserved retirement was cut short as she suffered a stroke, just three weeks after arriving. This could well be due to her old age or poor health - but we can’t rule out the stress of undertaking such a long, perilous journey. We are only grateful that in her final weeks she had the best care – Masha passed away surrounded by nature, as if it were the wild. Behind the scenes, we are exploring options to help rescue other animals too – but there is no quick and easy fix in the middle of such a volatile situation, and the sad story of Masha shows that moving animals presents potential challenges.\r\n\r\nWe are all hoping for the best possible outcome for the wild animals in zoos and aquariums. It is an extremely sad situation that serves as another reminder of why wild animals, should be protected and kept in the wild. A gradual phase out of keeping captive wild animals for commercial exploitation would prevent such tragic situations arising in the future.\r\n\r\nUkraine illustrates the peril we cause to wild animals when placing them in captivity and leaving them vulnerable to human-caused activity and tragedy. It is vital we have a future where wild animals are living a wild life, thriving in their natural habitat, not subject to life in captivity.', '1702903311blog104.jpg', '2023-12-18 12:41:51', 9, 17, 0),
(14, 'Starting an eCommerce Business vs. Starting a Rental Business', 'Embarking on the entrepreneurial journey is exciting, but choosing a suitable business model is crucial for success. In the digital age, two popular options are eCommerce and rental businesses. Both come with unique challenges and opportunities and understanding the key differences can help aspiring entrepreneurs make informed decisions.\r\n\r\nThree pillars define the difference between eCommerce and rental businesses: start-up costs, marketing, and customer interaction. You should use these to help inform your decision and determine which one is most suitable for you to take on, given your budget, resources, and how you want to interact with your new customers.\r\n\r\nE-COMMERCE VS RENTALS IN STATISTICS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe global eCommerce market is on a trajectory to reach a staggering $7.4 trillion by 2025, as projected by Statista. Simultaneously, the rental market, a cornerstone of various economies, boasts an estimated annual value of $57.5 billion in the United States alone, according to Statista.\r\n\r\nBut how does this lucrative landscape translate for aspiring business owners? Well, about 51.6% of small businesses find their roots in home-based ventures, a trend that seamlessly aligns with local rental enterprises, as highlighted by BusinessDIT.\r\n\r\nIt’s also important to confront the reality that establishing a new business is no small feat. The US Chamber of Commerce reports an average 3-year survival rate of around 50% for both online and offline businesses, underscoring the challenges and uncertainties entrepreneurs encounter in the initial stages.\r\n\r\nStart your rental\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COST OF STARTING A NEW BUSINESS\r\n\r\nThere is a striking difference between starting costs for eCommerce and rental businesses. eCommerce businesses require ongoing investments into inventory, which always involves capital upfront and on hand. However, once purchased, rental business inventory can generate rental income for years while the same initial stock gets rented repeatedly.\r\n\r\nSome of the biggest challenges for eCommerce businesses are staying updated with market trends, constantly replenishing stock, and managing storage space. Rental companies still need to manage storage space, and there’s cost to maintaining inventory, they don’t need to continually replenish stock while earning a steady income stream.\r\n\r\nTo be successful in eCommerce, you need a keen understanding of online platforms and digital marketing to drive sales. In contrast, rental businesses thrive on efficient inventory management and logistics. You should consider which appeals to you and what skills you can apply to your new business venture.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIND YOUR AUDIENCE AND MARKETING\r\n\r\n\r\nThe eCommerce landscape is certainly crowded, especially with the rise of social media stores and easy storefront tools. Standing out takes significant marketing, great branding, excellent customer experience, and often narrowing into niche products. If you go too broad, it’s almost impossible to differentiate.\r\n\r\nHowever, local rental markets have much more fragmentation with fewer big brands. Opportunities exist by renting out products not well covered in your particular geography and cornering that local market. Launching a new exciting rental offering with minimal competition can fare quite well.\r\n\r\nSocial media platforms like TikTok offer opportunities for eCommerce marketing, but finding and connecting with the right audience demands strategic efforts. Meanwhile, identifying industries or services with limited rental support in your region presents opportunities for innovation and market capture.\r\n\r\n\r\nE-COMMERCE VS RENTALS, WHICH SUITS YOU BEST?\r\n\r\n\r\nUltimately, the choice between starting an eCommerce or rental business depends on various factors, including personal preferences, market conditions, and the entrepreneur’s long-term goals. While eCommerce offers a global reach and vast potential, a rental business can provide a more localized, customer-centric experience.\r\n\r\nBoth business models have relatively low barriers to starting on the side before transitioning into full-time entrepreneurs. Aspiring entrepreneurs should carefully evaluate startup costs and strengths to determine if an online store or local rental better matches their skills, interests, and available capital.\r\n', '1702906333blog105.jpg', '2023-12-18 13:32:13', 11, 17, 0);
